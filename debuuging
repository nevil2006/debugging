Debugging is the process of detecting and removing existing and potential errors (also called ‘bugs’) in a code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly.
When various subsystems or modules are tightly coupled, debugging becomes harder as any change in one module may cause more bugs to appear in another. 

Sometimes it takes more time to debug a program than to code it.
